# Weather Dasboard

## Description
A weather app built using ajax requests. Upon searching a city, the current results are displayed along with a future five day forecast. Current day results feature Location Name, Date, Weather Icon (rainy, sunny, etc), Humidity, Temperature, Wind Speed, and UV Index. Based on UV Index, color styling will change from Red (8+), Orange (6-7), Yellow (3 to 5), and Green (0-2).
Search results will be stored to localStorage. On page load, the most recent historical search data will be populated.

## Installation
The html, css, and script files are all in the same folder. If they're kept in the same folder after cloning, the application will run. If the end user changes the file structure, weatherApp.html and hiscore.html must be updated with the new file paths for script.js and style.css in relation to weatherApp.html.

API Key will need to be obtained from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api) by creating your own account. After account creation, an API key will be availble to you [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Update the APIKey variable in script.js with your own - variable will need to be a string.
